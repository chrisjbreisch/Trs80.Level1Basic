# TRS-80 LEVEL I BASIC

This is an interpreter for Radio Shack's TRS-80 Level I BASIC.

Why?

Several reasons:
1. I've long been a "compiler junkie". I've been fascinated by compilers and interpreters for as long as I can remember.
2. Nostalgia. The very first computer I ever owned was a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I Level II. 
So, why not do a LEVEL II interpreter? Well, I plan to at some point. But even though the computer was a Model I Level II,
we got it with a programming book that described Level I BASIC. This was David A. Lien's famous (infamous?) book: 
[Radio Shack BASIC Computer Language It's Easier Thankj you think!](https://archive.org/details/Basic_Computer_Language_Its_Easier_Than_You_Think_1978_Radio_Shack),
a copy of which is embedded in the project.
3. I like to code for fun and to learn. While there isn't much in this code that's likely to help me much at my job, it
does help me think about problem solving, and it allows me to code in a low-pressure relaxed way. I've been working on this 
code off and on for about two years, and it's just now in a state where I feel like I can bring it public.
